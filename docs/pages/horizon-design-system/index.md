# Horizon Design System Overview

The [Horizon Design System (HDS)](https://website.nasa.gov/hds/) is NASA's design system for building consistent, accessible web applications. Terra UI Components includes the HDS theme (`horizon.css`) which provides a comprehensive set of CSS variables that you can use directly in your applications, even if you're not using Terra web components.

This section shows you how to use HDS design tokens, CSS variables, and themes to style your applications with NASA's design system.

## What is Horizon Design System?

Horizon Design System is NASA's official design system that provides:

-   **Design Tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing, and other design values
-   **Components**: Reusable UI components following NASA design guidelines
-   **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility standards and best practices
-   **Consistency**: Ensures visual and functional consistency across NASA applications

## Using the Horizon Theme

The `horizon.css` theme file contains all the HDS design tokens as CSS custom properties (CSS variables). You can import and use these variables in your own CSS, regardless of whether you're using Terra web components.

### Installation

To use the Horizon theme, import the CSS file in your HTML:

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nasa-terra/components@%VERSION%/%CDNDIR%/themes/horizon.scss"
/>
```

Or if you're using npm:

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="node_modules/@nasa-terra/components/%NPMDIR%/themes/horizon.scss"
/>
```

The theme is automatically applied to `:root`, so all CSS variables are available globally once imported.

### Dark Mode

The `horizon.scss` theme file includes both light and dark themes. Dark mode can be enabled in two ways:

**Automatic dark mode (requires opt-in):**

To enable automatic dark mode based on system preference, add the `terra-prefers-color-scheme` class to the `<body>` element:

```html
<body class="terra-prefers-color-scheme">
    <!-- Dark mode activates automatically based on system preference -->
    ...
</body>
```

**Manual dark mode override:**

```html
<html class="terra-theme-dark">
    <!-- Always use dark mode, regardless of system preference -->
    ...
</html>
```

**Force light mode:**

```html
<html class="terra-theme-horizon">
    <!-- Always use light mode, regardless of system preference -->
    ...
</html>
```

## Using CSS Variables in Your Code

Once you've imported the Horizon theme, you can use any of the design tokens in your own stylesheets. See the [Design Tokens](/tokens/typography) section for a complete reference of all available tokens.

```css
.my-button {
    background-color: var(--terra-color-nasa-blue);
    color: var(--terra-color-spacesuit-white);
    padding: var(--terra-spacing-small) var(--terra-spacing-medium);
    border-radius: var(--terra-border-radius-medium);
    font-family: var(--terra-font-family--inter);
    font-size: var(--terra-font-size-medium);
    transition: background-color var(--terra-transition-medium);
}

.my-button:hover {
    background-color: var(--terra-color-nasa-blue-shade);
}
```

```html
<button class="my-button">Click Me</button>
```

## Extending the Horizon Theme

You can extend the Horizon theme by creating your own stylesheet that overrides or adds to the existing variables. This is useful when you need custom colors or spacing that aren't in the base theme.

### Overriding Variables

To override existing variables, create a new stylesheet and scope it to the same selectors as the Horizon theme:

```css
:root,
:host,
.terra-theme-horizon {
    /* Override existing variables */
    --terra-color-nasa-blue: #0066cc;

    /* Add new custom variables */
    --my-custom-color: #ff9900;
    --my-custom-spacing: 2.5rem;
}
```

Make sure to import your custom stylesheet **after** the Horizon theme:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/horizon.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/my-custom-theme.css" />
```

### Creating Theme Variants

You can create entirely new theme variants by scoping your variables to a custom class:

```css
:host,
.terra-theme-custom {
    /* Your custom theme variables */
    --terra-color-primary: #8b5cf6;
    --terra-color-secondary: #ec4899;
    /* ... */
}
```

Then apply the theme class to activate it:

```html
<html class="terra-theme-custom">
    ...
</html>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Design Tokens**: Always use CSS variables instead of hardcoded values to maintain consistency and enable theming. See the [Design Tokens](/tokens/typography) section for available tokens.

2. **Respect the Color Palette**: Stick to the HDS color palette for brand consistency. Use neutrals for text and backgrounds.

3. **Accessibility**: HDS colors are tested for accessibility. When creating custom colors, ensure they meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.

4. **Typography Hierarchy**: Use the provided font sizes and weights to create clear visual hierarchy.

5. **Consistent Spacing**: Use the spacing scale for margins, padding, and gaps to maintain visual rhythm.

## Adoption Status

This page tracks the progress of Terra UI Components in adopting the Horizon Design System. Components are marked based on their current implementation status.

## Contributing

If you're working on implementing HDS support for a component, please:

1. Use design tokens from `horizon.css` instead of hardcoded values
2. Ensure dark mode support using the provided dark mode tokens
3. Follow HDS accessibility guidelines
4. Update this page when status changes

## Next Steps

-   Explore [Design Tokens](/tokens/typography) to see all available CSS variables
-   Learn about [HDS Components](/components/avatar) in the component documentation
-   Visit the [official HDS website](https://website.nasa.gov/hds/) for more information
